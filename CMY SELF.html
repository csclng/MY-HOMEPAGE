 <p class="lead">I am Marie Claire Nerona Casaclang. 
 I was born on the 2nd day of February, 2001. I live at 
 Pogomboa Street Libsong West Lingayen, Pangasinan. My mother’s name is Nena Nerona Casaclang, 
 she’s from Laoac Pangasinan and my father’s name is Franklin Cacapit Casaclang, he’s from Lingayen, 
 Pangasinan. I am the second child. My sister’s name is Marife Joy Nerona Casaclang, she’s graduated
 from Pangasinan State University with a Bachelor of Secondary major in English and my brother’s name is 
 Mark Kenneth Nerona Casaclang, he’s currently studying at Pangasinan National High School. In my Elementary, I graduated 
 at Libsong Elementary School. In my Junior and Senior High School, I graduated at Pangasinan National High School. My favorite color is yellow. 
 I loved travelling and listening to music. My parents are the only treasure that I have and I would say that my family is my life.

 <p class="lead">I describe myself as a flower, a yellow tulip.
 Yellow tulips now represent happiness, cheerfulness,
 and hope. Just like me, I’m always happy even though 
 I have a lot of problems and we all know that happy person is more successful.
 I am a cheerful person, and no matter what, I always have something positive to say,
 and big smile on my face. Hope is the one thing that can help us get through the darkness of times. 
 I don’t lose hope of achieving my goals and dreams in my life. I know that everything happens for a reason. 
 The Lord will make it happen when the time is right. During my high school days, me and my friends are always
 go to the cateen to buy some food, and sometimes we go to the library. Every December, we were have an event called High School
 Week at our school Pangasinan National High School. We have Street Dance, Power Dance, Modern Dance, Ballroom, etc. My best friend
 and I like to attend this event. So that, we joined Power Dance. I think that was the most memorable in my life. In my senior high school, 
 I expect the unexpected. Of all the strands, I know that HUMSS Strand is the hardest, but I was wrong. This HUMSS Strand are fun and not hard. 
 In my grade 11, I awarded as a Perfect Attendance, while in grade 12, from first to fourth quarter, I awarded as a with honors.</p>

 <p class="lead">Right now, I am in my third year of college,
taking a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics major in Computer Information Technology. 
 My college was not happy because we had a COVID-19 pandemic here in our country, which is the Philippines
 and it was my first year of college. But because of the viruses are rapidly increasing, the CHED announced 
 that instead of going to school, we will having online distance learning. I am happy and sad at the same time.
 I’m happy because we will not going to school. I’m sad because staring at a screen all day exhausts our eyes and brain. 
 It is also harmful. However in this situation, to achieve my dreams, I told myself that I had to do this, no matter what.
